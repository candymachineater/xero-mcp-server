# Xero MCP Server

This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation for Xero. It provides a bridge between the MCP protocol and Xero's API, allowing for standardized access to Xero's accounting and business features.

## Features

- Xero OAuth2 authentication with custom connections
- Contact management
- Chart of Accounts management
- Invoice creation and management
- MCP protocol compliance

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or pnpm
- A Xero developer account with API credentials

## Setup

### Create a Xero Account

If you don't already have a Xero account and organisation already, can create one by signing up [here](https://www.xero.com/au/signup/) using the free trial.

We recommend using a Demo Company to start with because it comes with some pre-loaded sample data. Once you are logged in, switch to it by using the top left-hand dropdown and selecting "Demo Company". You can reset the data on a Demo Company, or change the country, at any time by using the top left-hand dropdown and navigating to [My Xero](https://my.xero.com).

NOTE: To use Payroll-specific queries, the region should be either NZ or UK.

### Authentication

There are 2 modes of authentication supported in the Xero MCP server:

#### 1. Custom Connections

This is a better choice for testing and development which allows you to specify client id and secrets for a specific organisation.
It is also the recommended approach if you are integrating this into 3rd party MCP clients such as Claude Desktop.

##### Configuring your Xero Developer account

Set up a Custom Connection following these instructions: https://developer.xero.com/documentation/guides/oauth2/custom-connections/

##### Required Scopes

Custom connections require different scopes depending on when they were created. **All scopes in the relevant list must be added to your custom connection:**

| Custom Connection Created | Required Scopes |
|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Before Apr 29, 2026 | [SCOPES_V1](src/clients/xero-client.ts#L82-L90) (bundled permissions) |
| From Apr 29, 2026 | [SCOPES_V2](src/clients/xero-client.ts#L93-L107) (granular permissions) |

> **Optional:** add [`accounting.attachments`](src/clients/xero-client.ts#L122) to your custom connection to use the invoice attachment tools (`list-invoice-attachments` and `create-invoice-attachment`). It is requested as an extra on top of the list above and is dropped automatically if your connection was not granted it, so every other tool behaves exactly the same with or without it.

> **Note:** The MCP server automatically tries the attachments-inclusive scope lists first, then V1 scopes, then V2 scopes, stopping at the first list your connection accepts.
> 
> You can override these by setting the `XERO_SCOPES` environment variable to a space-separated list of scopes.

##### Integrating the MCP server with Claude Desktop

To add the MCP server to Claude go to Settings > Developer > Edit config and add the following to your claude_desktop_config.json file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "xero": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@xeroapi/xero-mcp-server@latest"],
      "env": {
        "XERO_CLIENT_ID": "your_client_id_here",
        "XERO_CLIENT_SECRET": "your_client_secret_here",
        "XERO_SCOPES": "accounting.invoices accounting.contacts accounting.settings"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `XERO_SCOPES` variable is optional. If omitted, the default scopes listed above will be used.

NOTE: If you are using [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) `"command": "npx"` section change it to be the full path to the executable, ie: `your_home_directory/.nvm/versions/node/v22.14.0/bin/npx` on Mac / Linux or `"your_home_directory\\.nvm\\versions\\node\\v22.14.0\\bin\\npx"` on Windows

#### 2. Bearer Token

This is a better choice if you are to support multiple Xero accounts at runtime and allow the MCP client to execute an auth flow (such as PKCE) as required.
In this case, use the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "xero": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@xeroapi/xero-mcp-server@latest"],
      "env": {
        "XERO_CLIENT_BEARER_TOKEN": "your_bearer_token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

NOTE: The `XERO_CLIENT_BEARER_TOKEN` will take precedence over the `XERO_CLIENT_ID` if defined.

##### Required Scopes for Bearer Token

When obtaining a bearer token, you must request the appropriate scopes. The scopes you request should be:

> **Note:** Some scopes are being deprecated in favour of more granular scopes. See the [Xero OAuth 2.0 Scopes documentation](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/guides/oauth2/scopes/) for details on deprecation timelines.

### Invoice creation: draft safety and payment terms

`create-invoice` always creates a **DRAFT** invoice. Optional `status` accepts only
`"DRAFT"`; it does not authorise or send invoices. Optional `dueDate` must be a real
`YYYY-MM-DD` calendar date (years 0001–9999), not a timestamp, null, or newline-padded
value. These controls are validated at both the MCP tool and public handler boundaries
before this path loads/authenticates the Xero client or writes an invoice.

An explicit `dueDate` wins unchanged. Select the payment terms in the calling
application/bot policy and pass the resolved calendar date **at creation**, rather
than creating an invoice with the wrong terms and repairing it afterwards. This
connector does not choose terms, count working days, select a jurisdiction/holiday
calendar, or reinterpret date-only values as UTC instants. A caller with a default
such as 14 working days must resolve its invoice-date basis and applicable calendar
before calling, and explicitly pass `dueDate`. Specific agreed/selected terms take
precedence over that caller default; do not retrofit existing invoices.

For backward compatibility, omitted `dueDate` still means the **UTC date of runtime
now plus 30 elapsed days**, independent of the invoice `date`. Omitted `status`
remains DRAFT. Omitted (or empty) `date` still uses today's UTC date. These are legacy
connector defaults, not a recommended payment-terms policy. Always provide the
intended invoice `date` and `dueDate` when calendar dates matter. For example, an
explicitly selected seven-calendar-day term for invoice date `2026-09-15` can be
represented as `date: "2026-09-15", dueDate: "2026-09-22", status: "DRAFT"`; this
example is not a universal default or a working-day calculation.

Both ACCREC invoices and ACCPAY bills support these controls. Existing line items,
reference-to-invoice-number mapping for ACCPAY, and all other defaults are unchanged.
The creation result includes Xero's returned due date when available. Deployment of
this source and the calling bot's payment policy are separate changes; installing a
policy alone cannot add missing fields to an older connector's tool schema.

### Integrating with Claude Desktop

To link your Xero MCP server in development to Claude Desktop go to Settings > Developer > Edit config and add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json` file:

NOTE: For Windows ensure the `args` path escapes the `\` between folders ie. `"C:\\projects\xero-mcp-server\\dist\\index.js"`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "xero": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["insert-your-file-path-here/xero-mcp-server/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
